# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a simple login and register chat application using MongoDB. It is aimed to show the integration of node js backend and react frontend. 


## Library used - SERVER
> npm i express mongoose nodemon socket.io bcrypt cors dotenv
### `express`
Back end web application framework for Node.js, de facto standard server framework for Node.js

### `cors`
a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin request

### `mongoose`
a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Express web application framework


## Library used - Frontend
> yarn add axios styled-components react-router-dom react-toastify

### `axios`
promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data

### `styled-components`
popular library that is used to style React applications. It allows you to build custom components by writing actual CSS in your JavaScript.

### `react-router-dom`
enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app

### `react-toastify`
beautify toast message components


## How to start server
after setting server 

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
